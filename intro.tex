\chapter{Introduction}

Over the past two decades, we have seen a growing number of networked sensors
and actuators installed in our connected world. These sensors and actuators
offer an unprecedented ability to monitor and act. Because of the enormous
potentials in solving societal-scale problems, this trend has gained significant
attraction, as demonstrated by many parallel efforts: Internet of Things
(IoT)~\cite{atzori2010internet}, Internet of Everything
(IoE)~\cite{bradley2013internet}, Industry 4.0~\cite{lasi2014industry}, The
Industrial Internet~\cite{eigner2018industrial}, TSensors (Trillion
Sensors)~\cite{bogue2014towards}, Machine to Machine
(M2M)~\cite{anton2014machine}, Smarter Planet~\cite{palmisano2008smarter},
etc. In this thesis, we refer to this trend as the swarm because it well
characterizes where the potentials lie: the number and the scale of
interconnected devices.

Swarm applications generate, transport, distill, and process large streams of
data across the wide area. For example, large cities such as London and Beijing
have deployed millions of cameras for surveillance and traffic
control~\cite{skynet, london.surveillance}. Buildings are increasingly equipped
with a wide variety of sensors to improve energy efficiency and occupant
comfort~\cite{dawson2010smap, krioukov2012building}. Interactive applications
that involve humans in the loop require a low latency response to engage the
users.

Riding on the popularity of the cloud infrastructure, swarm applications have
adopted the cloud as a universal computation resource and a storage
backend~\cite{carriots, grovestreams, sami, xively, gupta2014bolt,
  zachariah1001internet}. While this trend is understandable given the economic
benefits and simplified management of the cloud, it is not the best long term
approach. We will discuss issues related with privacy, security, availability,
latency, bandwidth, etc.

To compensate the cloud, new infrastructure focusing edge computing appear, such
as the fog~\cite{bonomi2012fog, bar2013fog}, cloudlet~\cite{ha2014towards,
  satyanarayanan2009case, chen2018application}, and swarmbox. While reducing the
distance, these further increase the heterogeneous landscape: swarm components
are of various types, requiring interfacing and interoperability across multiple
platforms and models of computation.

We recognize the challenges in developing swarm applications: constrained
resource and heterogeneous environment. We argue that the key to unfold the
potential of swarm applications is to allow applications to adapt to environment
changes. Manual adaptation or exhaustive explore the design space are not
feasible given the scale and large problem space.

To reduce developer efforts, we propose a three-stage development framework:
API, profiling and runtime use. In this thesis, we propose to provide adaptation
as a core abstraction in application development. In this way, we can build
tools to automatically learn the effect of adaptation and apply adaptation
strategies accordingly. We demonstrate this methodology with two systems
focusing on network resources and compute resources for swarm applications.

  abstraction allows for resilient swarm applications with less developer
  effort.}

\section{Challenges with Developing Swarm Applications}
\label{sec:chall-with-exist}

We identify the following challenges that are unique to swarm applications:

\para{Limited Resource.} Swarm systems rely on vast numbers of heterogeneous
sensors that are generating massive amounts of data.

\para{Ad-hoc Development.} Developers strive to make the application working due
to many moving pieces.

\para{Huge Design Space.} Many devices. Choices of sensors, algorithms, data
quality.

\para{Heterogeneous Platforms.} Ranging from cheap low power platforms to
powerful workstation.

These challenges are hard to overcome.

\section{Adaptation as a First-class Citizen}
\label{sec:adaptation}

\para{API.} To encode adaption and allow tools to be built in a systematic way.
Such API can be reused both for development and for execution: with a effective
runtime.

\para{Automatic Profiling and Optimization.} Free developer from manual tuning
knobs or struggle to explore a huge parameter space.

Take network resource as an example, when facing situations where the bandwidth
is not sufficient, applications deployed today either choose a conservative
setting (e.g.\,only delivering 360p videos) or leave their fate to the
underlying transport layer: (1) in the case of TCP, the sender will be blocked
and data are backlogged, leading to severe delay; (2) in the case of UDP,
uncontrolled packet loss occurs, leading to application performance
drop. Instead of ``suffering'' from a degraded network, applications can act
proactively by adjusting their behavior: reducing the data rate to ensure that
important data are delivered in time.

This network-adaptation profile remains the same across devices.

When we apply the same principle to compute resource, in Chapter 3, we focus on
performance modeling and improve the efficiency. Unique challenges:

\section{Summary of Results}
\label{sec:summary-results-1}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We propose to introduces new programming abstractions by which a developer
  expresses \emph{what} adaptations are available. Importantly, developers do
  not have to specify exactly when and how different adaptations are to be used
  which is instead left to the underlying framework.

\item Rather than rely on manual policies, we can build tools that automatically
  \emph{learns} adaptation policy that are Pareto optimal. This learning process
  can be both offline and online, exploiting parallelism, sampling or
  statistical approaches to efficiently explore the configuration space.

\item We also demonstrate how such strategy can be employed in running systems
  and adapt to resource changes. For example, \sysname{} matches the streaming
  data rate to the measured available bandwidth. Upon encountering network
  congestion, it increases the degradation level to reduce the data rate, such
  that no persistent queue builds up. To recover, it progressively decreases the
  degradation level after probing for more available bandwidth. Our experiments
  show that \sysname{} achieves sub-second latency with only nominal accuracy
  drop (2-6\%).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Thesis Organization}
\label{sec:thesis-organization}

The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows:

\begin{itemize}[topsep=5pt]
\item \autoref{cha:background} covers the background for swarm applications. I
  first summarize the landscape of the emerging swarm applications and show that
  they have fundamental differences from previous related concepts.  Many swarm
  applications are constructed using a cloud-centric approach. I then argue
  against it by discussing the pitfalls including security, privacy,
  scalability, latency, etc. A new tier of computing infrastructure, the edge,
  arises to accompany the cloud. While it reduces network latency and provides
  more resource, the edge has its own challenges, such as increased
  heterogeneity. The swarm landscape and the argument against the cloud are
  based on joint work with Nitesh Mor, John Kolb, Douglas S. Chan, Nikhil Goyal,
  Ken Lutz, Eric Allman, John Wawrzynek, Edward A. Lee, and John
  Kubiatowicz~\cite{zhang2015cloud}.
\item In \autoref{cha:netw-reso-adapt}, I present adapting swarm applications to
  network resources. Many swarm applications that transport large streams of
  data across the wide area faces challenges with the scarce and variable
  bandwidth. This chapter focus on \awstream{} that integrates application
  adaptation as a first-class programming abstraction and automatically learns
  an accurate profile that models accuracy and bandwidth trade-off. Using the
  profile to guide application adaptation at runtime, we demonstrate that
  \awstream{} achieves sub-second latency with only nominal accuracy drop
  (2-6\%).  The chapter is based on joint work with Xin Jin, Sylvia Ratnasamy,
  John Wawrzynek, and Edward A. Lee~\cite{zhang2018awstream}.
\item In \autoref{cha:comp-reso-adapt}, I present adapting swarm applications to
  compute resources. Due to the heterogeneous capabilities of end devices and
  variable network/serving latency, it is challenging to provide a consistent
  bounded response times for swarm applications. I propose to build a
  performance model that characterizes accuracy and processing time trade-off to
  guide the execution. This chapter focuses on efficient profiling: using
  Bayesian Optimization (BO) to address the large parameter space and profile
  transfer to address heterogeneous capabilities of different devices.
\item Chapter 5 discusses related research and industrial efforts.
\item Finally, I conclude this thesis and identify important research directions
  for future work.

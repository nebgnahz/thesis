\section{The Swarm at the Edge of the Cloud}

Over the past two decades, there has been a growing realization that large
numbers of sensors dispersed into the environment can help to solve
societal-scale problems. These sensory swarms (as they were called by Jan Rabaey
in a keynote talk at the Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference in
2008) can be wirelessly interconnected and interact with the cyber cloud, and
offer an unprecedented ability to monitor and act on a range of evolving
physical quantities. Such pervasive observations and measurements enable
unprecedented learning and modeling of the physical world under dynamically
changing conditions.

Wide-area streaming analytics are becoming pervasive, especially with the
emerging Internet-of-Thing (IoT) applications. Large cities such as New York,
Beijing and Seattle are deploying millions of cameras for traffic
control~\cite{london.surveillance,skynet}. Retails stores and critical areas
such as railway stations are also being monitored for abnormal
activities. Buildings are increasingly instrumented with a wide variety of
sensors to improve building energy use, occupant comfort, reliability and
maintenance~\cite{krioukov2012building}. Geo-distributed infrastructure, such as
Content Delivery Network (CDN), needs to analyze user requests (machine logs)
and optimize data placement to improve delivery efficiency. In these problems,
the data collected at the edge needs to be transported acoross the wide-area and
analyzed in real-time.

\section{Adaptation as a First-class Citizen}
\label{sec:adaptation}

When facing situations where the bandwidth is not sufficient, applications
deployed today either choose a conservative setting (e.g.\,only delivering 360p
videos) or leave their fate to the underlying transport layer: (1) in the case
of TCP, the sender will be blocked and data are backlogged, leading to severe
delay; (2) in the case of UDP, uncontrolled packet loss occurs, leading to
application performance drop. Instead of ``suffering'' from a degraded network,
applications can act proactively by adjusting their behavior: reducing the data
rate to ensure that important data are delivered in time.

\begin{itemize}
\item An in-depth study of wide-area streaming applications in the case of
  network resource variation.
\item The proposal of novel APIs to allow for a design space exploration between
  bandwidth and accuracy with minimal developer effort.
\item A prototype implementation that demonstrates application profiling and
  runtime adaptation.
\item Thorough evaluations based on three real-world applications under
  different scenarios.
\end{itemize}


\section{Summary of Results}
\label{sec:summary-results}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \sysname{} introduces new programming abstractions by which a developer
  expresses \emph{what} degradation functions can be used by the framework.
  Importantly, developers do not have to specify exactly when and how different
  degradation functions are to be used which is instead left to the \sysname{}
  framework.

\item Rather than rely on manual policies, \sysname{} automatically
  \emph{learns} a Pareto-optimal policy or strategy for when and how to invoke
  different degradation functions.  For this, we design a methodology that uses
  a combination of offline and online training to build an accurate model of the
  relationship between an application's accuracy and its bandwidth consumption
  under different combinations of degradation functions. Our solution exploits
  parallelism and sampling to efficiently explore the configuration space and
  learn an optimal strategy.

\item \sysname{}'s final contribution is the design and implementation of a
  runtime system that continually measures and adapts to network conditions.
  \sysname{} matches the streaming data rate to the measured available
  bandwidth, and achieves high accuracy by using the learned Pareto-optimal
  configurations.  Upon encountering network congestion, our adaptation
  algorithm increases the degradation level to reduce the data rate, such that
  no persistent queue builds up. To recover, it progressively decreases the
  degradation level after probing for more available bandwidth.

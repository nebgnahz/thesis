\chapter{Introduction}

Over the past two decades, we have seen a growing number of networked sensors
and actuators installed in our connected world. Collectively, these sensory
swarms---as they were called by Jan Rabaey in a keynote talk at ASPDAC
2008~\cite{rabaey2008brand}---offer an unprecedented ability to monitor and act
on a range of evolving physical quantities, holding enormous potentials in
solving societal-scale problems.

Wide-area streaming analytics are becoming pervasive, especially with the
emerging Internet-of-Thing (IoT) applications. Large cities such as New York,
Beijing and Seattle are deploying millions of cameras for traffic
control~\cite{london.surveillance,skynet}. Retails stores and critical areas
such as railway stations are also being monitored for abnormal
activities. Buildings are increasingly instrumented with a wide variety of
sensors to improve building energy use, occupant comfort, reliability and
maintenance~\cite{krioukov2012building}. Geo-distributed infrastructure, such as
Content Delivery Network (CDN), needs to analyze user requests (machine logs)
and optimize data placement to improve delivery efficiency. In these problems,
the data collected at the edge needs to be transported acoross the wide-area and
analyzed in real-time.

Realizing the swarm vision comes with several challenges for developing and
deploying swarm applications. Swarm systems rely on vast numbers of
heterogeneous sensors that are generating massive amounts of data. (2) Swarms
and swarmlets that dynamically recruit resources will compete for those
resources. (3) Heterogeneous: swarm components are of various types, requiring
interfacing and interoperability across multiple platforms and models of
computation.

This thesis argues that by providing adaptation as a core abstraction in
application development, we can allow swarm applications with better
performance. This thesis offers two systems with complete design, implementation
and evaluation regarding network and compute resource,
respectively.

\section{Adaptation as a First-class Citizen}
\label{sec:adaptation}

When facing situations where the bandwidth is not sufficient, applications
deployed today either choose a conservative setting (e.g.\,only delivering 360p
videos) or leave their fate to the underlying transport layer: (1) in the case
of TCP, the sender will be blocked and data are backlogged, leading to severe
delay; (2) in the case of UDP, uncontrolled packet loss occurs, leading to
application performance drop. Instead of ``suffering'' from a degraded network,
applications can act proactively by adjusting their behavior: reducing the data
rate to ensure that important data are delivered in time.

\section{Summary of Results}
\label{sec:summary-results-1}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \sysname{} introduces new programming abstractions by which a developer
  expresses \emph{what} degradation functions can be used by the framework.
  Importantly, developers do not have to specify exactly when and how different
  degradation functions are to be used which is instead left to the \sysname{}
  framework.

\item Rather than rely on manual policies, \sysname{} automatically
  \emph{learns} a Pareto-optimal policy or strategy for when and how to invoke
  different degradation functions.  For this, we design a methodology that uses
  a combination of offline and online training to build an accurate model of the
  relationship between an application's accuracy and its bandwidth consumption
  under different combinations of degradation functions. Our solution exploits
  parallelism and sampling to efficiently explore the configuration space and
  learn an optimal strategy.

\item \sysname{}'s final contribution is the design and implementation of a
  runtime system that continually measures and adapts to network conditions.
  \sysname{} matches the streaming data rate to the measured available
  bandwidth, and achieves high accuracy by using the learned Pareto-optimal
  configurations.  Upon encountering network congestion, our adaptation
  algorithm increases the degradation level to reduce the data rate, such that
  no persistent queue builds up. To recover, it progressively decreases the
  degradation level after probing for more available bandwidth.

\section{Thesis Organization}
\label{sec:thesis-organization}

The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item In Chapter 2, I first describe the landscape development for swarm
  applications.
\item In Chapter 3, I present the adaptation on network resources.
\item In Chapter 4, I present the adaptation on compute resources.
\item Chapter 5 discusses related research and industrial efforts related to
  adaptation.
\item Finally, I conclude this thesis and identify important research directions
  for future work.

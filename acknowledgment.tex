  First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor Prof.\,Edward Lee for his
  guidance and support in the past six years. The Ph.D. can be frustrated when
  you are stuck in a problem or cannot see the value of your work. Edward has a
  kind of magic that however frustrated I was when I entered his office, I
  always leave his office feeling inspired. He has a different perspective by
  connecting insights from diverse topics. Perhaps more influential to building
  proof-of-concepts, giving credit to people, and how to effectively communicate
  your ideas.

  During my Ph.D., I am mostly involved with the TerraSwarm project, which
  allowed me to collaborate with many outstanding researchers and
  professors. Prof.\,Bj\"orn Hartmann mentored me in my first project which led
  to my first publication at Berkeley. With Prof.\,John Kubiatowicz and many
  other folks in the Global Data Plane project, we wrote a position paper with a
  fun title: ``The Cloud is Not Enough.'' Prof\,John Wawrzynek offered
  invaluable feedback in the last few years of my Ph.D. Our discussion began
  with a grand SwarmOS vision and evolved into this specific direction on
  adaptation.

  I would also like to thank Prof.\, Syliva Ratnasamy, Prof.\, John Chuang for
  being on my thesis committee and for their feedback. Sylvia taught me to
  question the fundamental difference between swarm applications and other
  Internet applications. John offered perspectives from novel applications,
  often in a broader context.

  Research requires thorough evaluations to make a convincing argument and I
  learned the skills from Prof.\,Xin Jin and Dr.\,David Mellis. When working on
  AWStream, Xin taught me how to design each evaluation, run experiments, and
  present the results in compelling figures. With David, we have organized a
  one-day workshop to evaluate an user interface design for makers to use
  machine learning algorithms. Words fail me when describing how much I learned
  from them.

  I would also like to thank my undergraduate mentors Prof.\,Xiaofan Fred Jiang
  and Prof.\,Lin Zhang, without whom I may not have pursued a Ph.D.

  I enjoyed my stay in the DOP center and am grateful for having many friendly
  colleagues and friends---Eunsuk Kang, Ilge Akkaya, Mehrdad Niknami, and
  Eleftherios Matsikoudis, Hokeun Kim, Marten Lohstroh, Matt Weber, Antonio
  Iannopollo, Chris Shaver (Yvan Vivid), Michael Zimmer, Christos Stergiou, Dai
  Bui, Ben Lickly, Ankush Desai. I also really appreciate the work of Mary
  Stewart and Christopher Brooks to keep graduate life easy on all logistics. I
  am extremely impressed by and would like to learn Christopher's management
  skills, be it project, software, or life. His email ``New Year's Cleanup'' in
  2013 was an eye-opener to me about tidying up digital assets.

  Edward's group always have visiting scholars. to meet you and including Shuhei
  Emoto, Marjan Sirjani, Joseph Ng, Chadlia Jerad Ep Ben Haj Hmida, Moez Ben Haj
  Hmida, Maryam Bagheri, Victor Nouvellet, Atul Sandur, Andr\'es Goen, Ravi
  Akella.

  I would also like to thank other collaborators I have worked with---Nitesh
  Mor, Yu-Hsiang Sean Chen, Claire Tuna, Achal Dave, Jack Kolb, Eric Allman, Roy
  Wang, Bill N. Schilit, Jin Liang, Chao Mei.

  Graduate life would not be the same without friends to take my mind off the
  stress---Kaifei Chen, Qifan Pu, Xiang Gao, Peihan Miao, Zhuo Chen, Yuting Wei,
  Chaoran Guo, Qian Zhong, Tianshi Wang, Meng Wei.

  Last but not least, I am grateful to my family for always supporting me in
  advancing my study.  I would especially like to thank my girlfriend Limin
  Chen, for her love, company, and encouragement.

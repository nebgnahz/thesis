\chapter{Background}
\label{cha:background}

This chapter provides background context about our work. The emerging swarm
brings challenges. Existing cloud-centric solution does not work. Potential edge
infrastructure suffers from heterogeneity.

The emerging swarm by revisiting the development of cyber physical systems (CPS)
and wireless sensor network (WSN). One of the fundamental difference that the
swarm brings is the scale facilitated by the inter-connectivity, especially the
mature infrastructure cloud. As the cloud has become the \textit{de facto}
foundation around which distributed applications are constructed---a trend that,
while understandable, is not the best long term approach, and not well suited
for swarm applications. In particular, we will discuss the pitfalls with
directly connecting sensors to the cloud. A new trend promotes the use of local
resources gains attraction. We will then survey recent trend on edge computing.

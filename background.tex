\chapter{Background And Motivation}
\label{cha:background}

In this chapter, we analyze the trend of swarm applications. Through comparison
with previous topics such as wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems
and ubiquitous computing, we discuss the fundamental properties of swarm
applications. One key property is scale facilitated by the inter-connectivity,
especially the mature infrastructure cloud. The cloud has become the \textit{de
  facto} foundation around which distributed applications are constructed. This
trend, although understandable, is not the best long term approach and not well
suited for swarm applications. In particular, we will discuss the pitfalls with
directly connecting sensors to the cloud. To accompany the cloud, the edge
infrastructure comprised of local computing resources has been proposed. The
edge infrastructure, comes with new challenges.

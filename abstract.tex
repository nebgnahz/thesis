\begin{abstract}

  The swarm refers to the vast collection of networked sensors and actuators
  installed in our connected world. Many swarm applications transport, distill,
  and process large streams of data across the wide area in real time. The
  increasing volume of data generated at the edge challenges the existing
  approaches of directly connecting devices to the cloud.

  In this thesis, I will first present architecture design trends and challenges
  for developing swarm applications. Specifically, I will focus on the
  challenges from the scarce and variable WAN bandwidth and the heterogeneous
  compute environment (from low-power microcontrollers to powerful compute
  units). When network resources or compute resources are insufficient,
  non-adaptive applications will suffer from increased latency or degraded
  accuracy. Existing approaches that supports adaptation require extensive
  developer efforts to write manual policies or are limited to
  application-specific solutions.

  I propose a systematic and quantitative approach to build adaptive swarm
  applications. Our solution includes three stages: (1) a set of programming
  abstractions that allow developers to express adaptation options; (2) a
  combination of offline and online profiling tool that learns an accurate
  profile to characterize resource demands and application utilities; (3) a
  runtime system responsive to environment changes, maximizing application
  utility based on the learned profile. We evaluate the effectiveness of
  adaptation with several swarm applications: pedestrian detection, augmented
  reality, and monitoring log analysis. Our experiments show that all
  applications can achieve low latency responses with nominal accuracy drops.

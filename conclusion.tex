\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{cha:concl-future-work}

This thesis claims that \textit{systematic adaptation and quantitative profiling
  are the key to a resilient swarm}. In this thesis, I have studied swarm
applications and demonstrated how to allow adaptation for network and compute
resources. This chapter summarizes the contributions of this thesis and
discusses valuable directions for future work.

\section{Conclusions and Contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}

\paraf{Reviewing the Emerging Swarm.} This thesis provides an overview of
emerging swarm and the architecture design trends for swarm applications. We
discuss issues with existing approaches that directly connect devices to the
cloud. We also analyze the challenges swarm applications face, with a focus on
constrained resources and heterogeneous environment.

\para{Systematic and Quantitative Adaptation.} The core of this thesis is a
systematic and quantitative approach for developing adaptive swarm
applications. Instead of relying on manual policies, developers use well-defined
programming abstractions to express adaptation options. We then use a
data-driven profiling to automatically learn the profile---a set of
Pareto-optimal configurations---that characterizes resource demands and
application performance.

\para{Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of \awstream{}.} Swarm applications
that communicate across the wide area need to handle the scarce and variable WAN
bandwidth. We present a complete design and implementation of the framework
\awstream{} for network resource adaptation. We have developed several swarm
applications: pedestrian detection, augmented reality, and monitoring log
analysis. Our experiments show that all applications can achieve sub-second
latency with nominal accuracy drops.

\para{Improving Profiling Efficiency.} In \awstream{}, we demonstrated how
parallelism and sampling techniques can improve profiling efficiency. For
network resource adaptation, we have improved the efficiency further to address
two challenges: Bayesian Optimization to address the large parameter space;
profile transfer to address device heterogeneity.

\section{Future Directions}
\label{sec:future-directions}

Future work for programming abstraction. Generalization. As the number of
inter-connected devices continue to grow, we expect to see more diverse swarm
applications. One future direction is to test and evaluate the adaptation
techniques in new applications and further reduce developer efforts. Programming
abstraction. Further reduce developer effort. While \awstream{} simplifies
developing adaptive applications, there are still application-specific parts
required for developers: wrapping appropriate \maybe{} calls, providing training
data, and implementing accuracy functions. We plan to build libraries for common
degradation operations and accuracy functions, similar to machine learning
libraries.

For profiling.

Future directions on runtime adaptation. For \awstream{}, adaptation more
proactively if we can predict bandwidth changes. Recent research on adaptive
video streaming explores model predictive control (MPC)~\cite{yin2015control,
  sun2016cs2p} and neural network~\cite{mao2017neural}. We plan to explore these
techniques next. Build server scheduler to use the profile for compute
resources.

From adapting to resources to recruiting new resources. Swarm applications
should be able to dynamically recruit resources, such as sensors, actuators,
data, and computing infrastructure. One promising work is the mutable accessors
discussed by Brooks et al.~\cite{brooks2018component}. An mutable accessor is an
abstract interface specification for candidate accessors. It reifies a concrete
accessor downloaded from the Internet or retrieved through a discovery
mechanism. This reification serves as recruiting resources for the swarm
applications.

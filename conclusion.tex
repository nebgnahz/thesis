\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{cha:concl-future-work}

Swarm and IoT has huge potentials but also challenges.

In this thesis, we tackle network resource adaptation and compute resource
adaptation.

\para{Network Resource Adaptation.} \sysname{} addresses scarce and variable WAN
bandwidth. It is tradeoff between application accuracy and data size demand.

\para{Compute Resource Adaptation.} Addresses heterogeneous platforms and large
parameter space. It is tradeoff between application accuracy and processing
times.

Overall, a systematic and quantitative approach for adaptation

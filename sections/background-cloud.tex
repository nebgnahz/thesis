\section{Massive Adoption of Cloud Platforms}
\label{sec:cloud}

Over the last few years, cloud computing has shaped the software industry and
made the development and deployment of web services easier than ever.  Public
cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Rackspace offer pay-as-you-go
services for the general public.  Such a service model has reduced capital
expenses, enabled elasticity for dynamic load adaption, and simplified resource
management~\cite{armbrust2010view}.

We have seen a huge recent trend of migrating computations and services to the
cloud.  Taking Amazon S3 as an example, over two trillion objects were reported
stored in the system back as of April 2013~\cite{barr2013amazon}.  Riding on
this popularity, application developers in the IoT space have blithely adopted
the cloud as a universal computation and storage backend.  This approach has
been taken by both industrial efforts (such as Carriots~\cite{carriots},
GroveStreams~\cite{grovestreams}, SAMI~\cite{sami}, Xively~\cite{xively}) and
academic research~\cite{gupta2014bolt, zachariah1001internet}.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt, topsep=1pt]
\item[\autoref{sec:perf-modeling}] Compared with naive approaches (random and
  gradient-based search), \sysname{} finds a Pareto front that is closer to the
  optimal (\autoref{fig:bo}).
\item[\autoref{sec:runtime}] For all applications, \sysname{} achieves bounded
  service latency across various network conditions (\autoref{fig:end-to-end}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Modeling}
\label{sec:perf-modeling}

This section shows that BO can effectively explore the large design space and
come up with a better Pareto-optimal parameter set. We compare \sysname{} with
two baseline profilers: $(i)$ greedy approach as described in
VideoStorm~\cite{zhang2017live}; $(ii)$ random sampling.

Greedy converts MOO into SOO with a parameter $X = \beta$ $A - \beta T$. It
starts with a random configuration $c$ and then picks a neighbor configuration
(by changing the value of a random dimension). If the new configuration $c'$
returns a higher $X$, it updates and iterate form $c'$ again. Otherwise, it
picks a different neighbor $c''$ by changing another dimension. It starts with
three random starting point; it also evaluate a number of random $\beta$.

\autoref{fig:bo} shows that with the same budget (the number of parameters to
evaluate), our profiler can find parameters with better trade-offs between
application accuracy and processing times.

  \caption{Using Face as an example, BO evaluates 50 configurations and
    recommends 29 configurations as the Pareto-optimal boundary (the blue
    line). Greedy and Random find sub-optimal Pareto configurations with a
    budget of 80 evaluations (the yellow line in each figure).}

\subsection{Profile Transfer.}

Profile transfer without re-running the entire BO. The ``Pareto-optimal'' is
horizontally stretched/compressed.

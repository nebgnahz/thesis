\section{Chapter Summary}
\label{sec:chap-summary}

In this chapter, we present a study that allows bounded response times for wide
area prediction serving.

The central goal is to adapt computation to different platforms: end devices are
limited in compute power; the edge/cloud suffer from variable network delays and

Performance modelling is challenging due to the large parameter space. Previous
approaches use random search or coordinate/greedy approach • We propose Bayesian
Optimization (BO) for profiling 2. Heterogeneous capabilities (and not available
when profiling) • Profile transfer: refine existing Pareto-optimal points

One can view our approach as an extended version of the original ``CAP''
theorem. Consistency, as a form of correctness, is relaxed to be accuracy
ranging from 0 to 1. Availability is relaxed to be the response times. Under
network partition, traditional systems choose either consistency or
availability. Here we explore the direction of maximizing application accuracy
(correctness) with given availability guarantee.

\section{Chapter Summary}
\label{sec:chap-summary}

In this chapter, we present a study that allows bounded response times for wide
area prediction serving.

One can view our approach as an extended version of the original ``CAP''
theorem. Consistency, as a form of correctness, is relaxed to be accuracy
ranging from 0 to 1. Availability is relaxed to be the response times. Under
network partition, traditional systems choose either consistency or
availability. Here we explore the direction of maximizing application accuracy
(correctness) with given availability guarantee.

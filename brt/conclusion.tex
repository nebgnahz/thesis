\section{Chapter Summary}
\label{sec:chap-summary}

We have presented our study of enabling adaptation toward compute resources in
the swarm space. Because end devices are limited in compute power, the
edge/cloud suffer from variable network delays and service requests, it is
essential to be able to adapt computation on different platform to meet response
time deadlines.

To allow the adaptation, we need a performance model that characterizes the
trade-off between application accuracy and processing times. Performance is
challenging: for the large parameter space, previous approaches use random
search or coordinate/greedy approach. and we propose Bayesian Optimization (BO)
for profiling; (2) for heterogeneous computing capabilities and not available
when profiling, we use profile transfer: refine existing Pareto-optimal points.

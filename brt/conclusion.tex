\section{Chapter Summary}
\label{sec:chap-summary}

Swarm applications that rely on computation-heavy tasks face the challenge of
heterogeneous compute capabilities and variable network/service load. In order
to provide bounded response times, we propose to adapt computation based on a
performance model that characterizes the trade-off between application accuracy
and processing times.

Performance modeling for computation adaptation is challenging due to the large
parameter space and heterogeneous device capabilities. This chapter presents two
techniques that improve profiling efficiency: $(i)$ BO significantly reduces the
number of samples needed from the large parameter space, by more than 50$\times$
compared to an exhaustive profiling; $(ii)$ profile transfer eliminates the need
of profiling for each new device as we only need to measure the processing times
for Pareto-optimal configurations.

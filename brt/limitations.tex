\para{More case studies.} This chapter demonstrates the effectiveness of BO
(\autoref{fig:bo}) and profile transfer (\autoref{fig:transfer}). Our evaluation
uses Viola-Jones face detector, a popular computer vision algorithm, as the
primary case study. We have also applied our profiling to
HOG~\cite{dalal2005histograms} and the results are similar (hence omitted from
this thesis). In the future, we expect to conduct more case studies with diverse
algorithms.

\para{Server scheduling.} Our current use of the profile is simple: we find the
algorithm/parameter that maximizes application accuracy given a processing time
deadline. We envision that in a model serving system that handles a large number
of requests, the profile can help with scheduling, e.g., the server tune
processing times for some requests in order to maximize throughput.

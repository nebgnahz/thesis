\chapter{Compute Resource Adaptation}
\label{cha:comp-reso-adapt}

In this chapter, we focus on swarm applications that rely on heavy computation
tasks and need to adapt to different computing resources. To create an engaging
user experience, many swarm applications require bounded response times (e.g.,
100 ms). However, there is a large discrepancy between the capabilities of swarm
platforms and unpredictable network/service workload, it is challenging to
achieve bounded response times.

Our observation that to achieve the same task, there are often more than one
options: different algorithms or different parameters for the same algorithm. To
achieve bounded response times (BRT), we propose that applications must be able
to adapt to available resource and select the right algorithm/parameter given
the deadline.

Achieving the adaptation is challenging due to the large parameter space and
heterogeneous platforms with different capabilities. We address the performance
modeling with two techniques: 1) For individual platform, the profiling uses
Bayesian Optimization (BO), which, as we will demonstrate, outperforms previous
approaches based on random search or coordinate/greedy approach. 2) To address
heterogeneous capabilities, we use profile transfer that only refines existing
Pareto-optimal points without doing performance modeling from scratch. We
empirically validate our approaches with several computer vision tasks.

\chapter{Compute Resource Adaptation}
\label{cha:comp-reso-adapt}

Many swarm applications rely on heavy computation tasks to finish within bounded
deadlines. However, because there is a large discrepancy between the
capabilities of swarm platforms and unpredictable network/service workload, it
is challenging to achieve bounded response times.

We observe that to achieve the same task, there are often more than one
algorithms or the algorithm have configurable parameters. The combination of
algorithms and parameters defines a large search space and affects the
processing times and application accuracy.

To achieve bounded response times (BRT), our stand is that applications must be
able to adapt to available resource and select the right algorithm and the right
parameter given the deadline.

Achieving the adaptation is challenging due to the large parameter space and
heterogeneous platforms with different capabilities. We address the performance
modeling with two techniques: 1. We propose Bayesian Optimization (BO) for
profiling. Previous approaches use random search or coordinate/greedy
approach. 2. Heterogeneous capabilities (and not available when
profiling). Profile transfer: refine existing Pareto-optimal points.

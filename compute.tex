\chapter{Compute Resource Adaptation}
\label{cha:comp-reso-adapt}

In this chapter, we focus on swarm applications that rely on heavy computation,
such as machine learning (ML) inference. To create an engaging user experience,
these applications need to offer bounded response times (e.g., 100 ms or
sub-second). However, swarm platforms have a large discrepancy of computing
capabilities and end devices are often now powerful enough to run an algorithm
as is. If the application offloads computation to other resources such as the
edge or the cloud, it faces the challenge of unpredictable network delays and
service workload. To meet the response time requirement, we propose to adapt the
computation to each platform in specific contexts.

The ability to adapt comes from our observation that to achieve the same task,
there are often more than one options: different algorithms or different
parameters for the same algorithm. These options result in different processing
times and application accuracy. If we can build a performance model that
characterizes the options' impact, the application can choose the right
algorithm/parameter adaptively depending on its compute power and the deadline.

Achieving compute resource adaptation with performance modeling is
challenging. In contrast to the profiling discussed in
\autoref{cha:netw-reso-adapt}, we are facing a much larger parameter space where
exhaustive search (despite we can use parallelism) is not feasible. In addition,
the bandwidth-accuracy profile remains the same across platforms while the
processing times vary depending on the compute platforms. The swarm has a wide
spectrum of devices with heterogeneous computing capabilities.

This chapter is step further in refining our profiling techniques. Specifically,
we address the large parameter space with Bayesian Optimization (BO) and address
the heterogeneous capabilities with profile transfer. We empirically validate
our approaches using Viola-Jones face detector as the primary case study.

\section{Massive Adoption of Cloud Platforms}
\label{sec:cloud}

Cloud Computing~\cite{armbrust2010view} delivers computing services over the
Internet, offering computing as a utility. The term ``cloud'' often refers to
the hardware and systems in the datacenters that provide those computing
services. A cloud can be made public such that customers use it in a
pay-as-you-go manner, such as Amazon Web Services, Google AppEngine, and
Microsoft Azure. In this way, the cloud offers a number of advantages over
traditional IT approaches.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Cost.} The cloud eliminates up-front capital expenses and resource
  management. Cloud users can focus on their application logic without hiring IT
  experts to manage on-site datacenters. These time-consuming IT chores include
  provisioning, physical configuration, hardware upgrades, software patching,
  etc.

\item \textbf{Elasticity.} The cloud offers an illusion of infinite resources on
  demand. It allows cloud users to start small and increase their resources with
  the demand growth. Cloud users do not need to plan far ahead for provisioning
  and can request the right amount of resources when they are needed. They can
  also request specialized hardware resources, such as FPGA, GPU, and TPU.

\item \textbf{Utilization.} The pay-as-you-go model incentives users to release
  the resources that are no longer needed. As a result, these resources can be
  reused. Taking advantage of statistical multiplexing, the cloud can greatly
  improve resource utilization.

\item \textbf{Availability.} The cloud facilitates data availability and
  sharing. All end users can access the services ``anytime, anywhere'', making
  collaboration seamless. In addition, the cloud keeps the data safe and durable
  (with backups, disaster recovery).

\end{enumerate}

Because of these benefits, cloud computing has shaped the software industry and
made the development and deployment of web services easier than ever. It has
become the \textit{de facto} central piece around which modern web applications
are constructed. The trend of migrating computation, storage and services to the
cloud is evident. Taking Amazon S3 as an example, over two trillion objects were
reported stored in the system back as of April 2013~\cite{barr2013amazon}.

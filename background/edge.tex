Even when devices can utilize more standard communication protocols such as
WiFi, the gateways still exist as downloadable applications that run on
cellphones or computers.  Companies tend to provide their own gateways (such as
Ninja Sphere~\cite{ninja}, SmartThings Hub~\cite{smartthings}, Wink
Hub~\cite{wink}); and researchers adopt a similar approach (e.g., HomeHub for
the LoT~\cite{brush2013lab}).

The fact that custom gateways are an integral part of IoT applications leads
directly to ``stovepipe'' solutions or balkanization. Data and services from one
company cannot be shared or utilized by devices from another company: connection
protocols, data formats, and security mechanisms (when present) are proprietary
and often undocumented.

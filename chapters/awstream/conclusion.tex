\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presents \sysname{}, a stream processing system for a wide variety of
applications by enabling developers to customize degradation operations with
\maybe{} operators. Our automatic profiling tool generates an accurate profile
that characterizes the trade-off between bandwidth consumption and application
accuracy. The profile allows the runtime to react with precision. Evaluations
with three applications show that \sysname{} achieves sub-second latency with
nominal accuracy drop. \sysname{} enables resilient execution of wide-area
streaming analytics with minimal developer effort.

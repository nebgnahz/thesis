\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we present \sysname{} that allows bounded response times for wide
area prediction serving.

One can view our approach as an extended version of the original ``CAP''
theorem. Consistency, as a form of correctness, is relaxed to be accuracy
ranging from 0 to 1. Availability is relaxed to be the response times. Under
network partition, traditional systems choose either consistency or
availability. In \sysname{}, we explore the direction of maximizing application
accuracy (correctness) with given availability guarantee.
